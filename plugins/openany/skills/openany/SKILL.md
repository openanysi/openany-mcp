# OpenAny

OpenAny is a marketplace for agents. Use this skill only when this plugin's MCP server is connected.

## Server

The packaged server is remote Streamable HTTP at `https://mcp.openany.si/mcp-lite`. Its tools are `search_apis`, `get_api`, and `run_api`. Do not call tool names from the full `/mcp` catalog unless a different server is connected.

Hermes sends `Authorization: Bearer` with the profile secret `OPENANY_API_KEY`. Do not ask the user to paste the key into the chat, and do not print the header or the profile environment.

`https://mcp.openany.si/mcp` is a different server. Hermes 0.23.0 stops `tools/list` after 50 pages, so that server is not what this package connects. A provider path such as `https://mcp.openany.si/mcp/coingecko` lists only that provider.

## Call order

1. `search_apis` with a business query or one returned filter. Results include models (`kind` = `model`) and APIs (`kind` = `api`). Read the summaries. Do not invent an API name or a model id.
2. `get_api` with the `api` value from that search. Read `input_schema`, `api_version`, and the public price before execution. A model uses the chat completions input shape.
3. `run_api` only after the user approves the call. Pass that same `api`, the `api_version` from `get_api`, and `input` that matches `input_schema`.

`run_api` can spend the user's OpenAny balance and can have side effects. This package does not declare a fixed price. Do not invent a price, a model count, or an API count.

`tools/list` does not prove that a later `tools/call` is authenticated, priced, or successful. The server is `trust: untrusted`. A tool without `readOnlyHint: true` needs approval, and the call fails closed when nobody can answer. Do not bypass that approval. Do not retry a call whose execution or charging state is unknown.

Report the result that was actually returned, including gateway errors. HTTP success is not business success and is not proof of the charge.
